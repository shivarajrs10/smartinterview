# Smart interview

Many times, as a recruiter, you'll find both active and passive candidates who fulfill a job description. Some problems arise when the candidate has to go to the office to conduct an interview with the recruiter. The main issues are related to distance and transportation. Also, if we are dealing with a passive candidate who already has a job, conducting an interview is almost impossible. If you can reach them, you need to provide some facilities to proceed with the interview.
